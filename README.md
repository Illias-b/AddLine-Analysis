## Goal
The AddLine Analysis Dashboard aims to scrutinise line addition events in customer accounts, focusing on patterns in account size, line of business (LOB), value, and sales segment during acquisition. Key aspects include:
- Types of lines added (e.g., SIMO, data sims, handsets).
- Stages in the contract cycle when lines are added.
- Percentage of lines added during SIM upgrades.
- Distribution across LOBs (SIMO, handset, data, broadband, tablet).
- Marketing opt-in vs opt-out comparison.
- Sales channels involved in line additions.

## Approach and Tools

### SQL Query for Data Extraction and Analysis
- Develop SQL queries for data extraction regarding line additions.
- Analyse patterns in LOB, account size, sales segment, and contract cycle.
- Segment data based on marketing preferences and sales channels.

### Tableau Dashboard Development
- Create an interactive Tableau dashboard for visual data representation.
- Implement filters and selectors for LOB, account size, sales channel, contract cycle stage, and marketing preference.
- Integrate graphs, heat maps, and trend lines to illustrate frequency and characteristics of line additions.

## Result
This dashboard will provide insights into line addition patterns, supporting strategic decisions in marketing, sales strategies, and customer relationship management.

## Additional Considerations
- Ensure adherence to data privacy and compliance, particularly for marketing opt-in/opt-out information.
- Update the dashboard regularly with current data.
- Maintain data integrity through accurate SQL queries.
